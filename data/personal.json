  "bio": "Hey! I'm Manikumar — a calm, introverted guy who enjoys exploring tech at my own pace. I’m currently diving into Android Development with Kotlin, Data Science basics, Generative AI, UI/UX, and core web development. I love understanding how things actually work, not just following tutorials. I learn quietly, build consistently, and always try to level up one small step at a time.",
